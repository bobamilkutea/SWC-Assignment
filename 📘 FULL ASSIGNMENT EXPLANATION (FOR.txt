📘 FULL ASSIGNMENT EXPLANATION (FOR CURSOR AI)
🎯 Assignment Objective

This assignment demonstrates the application of three programming paradigms within a unified Smart University Management System:

Functional Programming → Haskell

Logic Programming → Prolog

Multi-Paradigm Programming → Python

The system follows a layered architecture:

Python → Interface & Integration Layer

Haskell → Functional Computation Engine

Prolog → Rule-Based Reasoning Engine

JSON → Main Shared Database

🏗 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
                Python (Interface Layer)
                         ↓
        ----------------------------------------
        ↓                                      ↓
   Haskell (Computation)              Prolog (Logic Engine)
                         ↑
                  main_database.json
main_database.json

Acts as the central shared database that:

Stores students

Stores programs

Stores courses

Stores prerequisites

Stores grades

All three languages must use this same JSON file.

🟢 PART A — HASKELL (Functional Programming Layer)
Objective

Perform grade analysis using functional programming principles.

Requirements

Read student data from main_database.json

Extract grades

Implement pure functions to:

Calculate student average

Identify distinction students (average > 80)

Find top-performing student

Output results in JSON format (grades_output.json)

Functional Programming Principles Used

Pure functions

Immutable data

Higher-order functions (map, filter)

Function composition

No side effects (except final output)

Example Functional Logic

map → calculate average for all students

filter → select distinction students

fold → determine top student

🟢 PART B — PROLOG (Logic Programming Layer)
Objective

Implement rule-based reasoning using facts and rules.

Requirements

Load student data from main_database.json

Represent:

student(StudentID, Name, Program)

completed(StudentID, Course)

prerequisite(Course, Prerequisite)

Implement rules to:

Check course eligibility

Recommend courses

Determine graduation eligibility

Logic Programming Principles Used

Declarative rule definition

Pattern matching

Backtracking

Fact-based knowledge representation

Logical inference

Example Rule Concepts

Eligible for course:
A student is eligible if all prerequisites are completed.

Eligible for graduation:
A student is eligible if all required courses for their program are completed.

🟢 PART C — PYTHON (Multi-Paradigm + Integration Layer)
Objective

Integrate both engines and provide a system interface.

Python must:

Read main_database.json

Call Haskell to compute averages

Call Prolog to check rules

Merge outputs

Display structured result

Use:

OOP

Functional programming (map, filter, lambda)

One external library (pandas recommended)

Copy everything below into Cursor AI.

📌 PART C IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS (FOR CURSOR AI)
Goal

Build the Python integration layer of a Smart University Management System that:

Reads data from main_database.json

Dynamically calls:

Haskell program (grades computation)

Prolog program (eligibility logic)

Combines outputs

Displays results in a structured dashboard

Uses OOP and functional programming

Uses pandas for data presentation

Step 1 — Project Structure
project/
│
├── main_database.json
├── grades.hs
├── advisory.pl
├── python_main.py
Step 2 — Python Requirements
1️⃣ Implement Student Class (OOP)

Class must contain:

id

name

program

completed_courses

grades

average (from Haskell)

distinction_status (from Haskell)

graduation_eligibility (from Prolog)

recommended_courses (from Prolog)

Include method:

predict_performance()

Logic:

= 85 → "Excellent"

= 70 → "Good"

= 50 → "Average"

else → "At Risk"

2️⃣ Read main_database.json

Use:

json module

Load students list

3️⃣ Call Haskell Using subprocess

Python must execute:

runhaskell grades.hs

Haskell should output JSON containing:

student id

average

distinction status

top student

Capture output using subprocess.run()

Parse JSON response.

4️⃣ Call Prolog Using subprocess

Python must execute:

swipl -f advisory.pl -g run_query,halt.

Prolog should output JSON containing:

student id

graduation eligibility

recommended courses

Capture and parse JSON.

5️⃣ Merge Results

Match students using student ID.

Combine:

Base data (JSON database)

Haskell results

Prolog results

Create Student objects.

6️⃣ Functional Programming Usage

Use:

map → generate performance predictions

filter → detect at-risk students

lambda expressions

list comprehensions

Example required features:

Identify all distinction students

Identify at-risk students

Rank students by average

7️⃣ Use pandas

Create DataFrame with:

ID

Name

Program

Average

Distinction

Graduation Eligible

Recommended Courses

Predicted Performance

Display formatted dashboard.

8️⃣ Console Interface

Create simple menu:

View All Students

Check Specific Student

Show Top Performer

Show At-Risk Students

Exit

Python must trigger Haskell & Prolog when needed.

📘 Explanation Section (150–200 Words Required)

Cursor must generate explanation describing:

Python supports OOP through class-based modeling.

Python supports functional paradigm using map, filter, lambda.

Python integrates external engines using subprocess.

Demonstrates multi-paradigm capability.

Acts as integration layer in layered architecture.

🔥 What Makes This Full-Mark Level

Your Part C must demonstrate:

✔ Proper class design
✔ Functional programming usage
✔ External system integration
✔ Structured output
✔ Clean architecture
✔ Clear explanation

Not just “reading JSON”.

It must show understanding of:

System architecture

Multi-paradigm design

Data integration

🧠 Final Advice

Do NOT:

❌ Hardcode logic inside Python
❌ Calculate averages inside Python
❌ Check graduation rules inside Python

Those belong to:

Haskell

Prolog

Python integrates only.
